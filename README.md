I recently updated the website to astro framework, for better experience and adding different modules with ease. I have completed the main landing page and currently working on the "posts" module, I have plans to make more modules. I will continue to add my plans or other improvements on the issue tab in github or via occasional posts on my website.

### How posts work
I put my notes as markdown on the "content/posts" directory with a title and date at the frontmatter. and it automatically gets listed on the posts page!
