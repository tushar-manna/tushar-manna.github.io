### Introduction
so after long a long procrastination (well not totally!), I finally finished the feature and it's actually working better than I imagined! For now I am not focusing on the UI/UX, I am working on the core features for now, I can always polish later. I am gonna be honest I barely knew Astro. This project had been a great learning experience and I am enjoying the learning curve!


### Upcoming features
- Graph view like obsidian, connecting related notes in wiki style links.
- A versioning system to keep old versions of notes.
- UI and UX improvements.


### Authenticity
I will always keep my posts authentic, I will never use AI to generate any of my posts, I might use it for suggestions or improvements.


so we are ready to deploy!
